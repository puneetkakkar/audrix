<h1 align="center">AUDRIX - AUDIO RECOMMENDATION MIX PLATFORM</h1>

<br>

#### Problem Statement 
One of the major problems of recommender systems in general, and music recommender systems in particular is the cold start problem, i.e., when a new user registers to the system or a new item is added to the catalog and the system does not have sufficient data associated with these items/users. In such a case, the system cannot properly recommend existing items to a new user (new user problem) or recommend a new item to the existing users.

##### Solution
Extract audio metadata features from the audio signals and use content-based learning of the user interest, and user's friends interest in order to effect recommendation.

### Key features :- 

1. **Stream efficiently based on the network bandwidth**

4. **Authentication via social auth/Oauth 2.0**
5. **Rich features for music player** 
6. **Full screen player support** 
7. **Support for hotkeys while playing music** 
7. **Separate recommendation zone with recommendations on the fly using ML algorithms with good accuracy**
